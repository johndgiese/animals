My goal for sprint 1 is to:

- define a grid with animals of a single species
- these animals never die
- each turn they move rest/left/right/up/down on the grid
- they grid is bounded
- the state of the grid (and time) is printed on each iteration
- the world is initialized with a specified height, width, and number of animals
- animals move about randomly
- only one animal can occupy a space on the grid
